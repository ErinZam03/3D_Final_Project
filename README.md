How do I approach designing software?
My approach to software design involves a combination of planning, simplification, and iterative testing. In this project, I began by analyzing the workspace scene in my chosen reference image and breaking down each object into basic geometric shapes like boxes, cylinders, and planes. This approach allowed me to efficiently model each element with low-polygon designs, maintaining performance while achieving a realistic look. By focusing on modular design, I could create each object independently, making adjustments as needed without impacting the overall structure.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on this 3D scene helped me refine my skills in modeling and texturing. For instance, I learned to apply realistic textures that enhanced the visual quality without increasing polygon count. Lighting design was another skill I developed, as I needed to balance different types of lights to illuminate the scene effectively. These skills are valuable for any future projects involving visualization and can be applied across various fields of computer graphics.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process I followed was iterative, beginning with basic shapes and gradually adding details. After modeling each object, I refined their textures and applied lighting to create depth. This incremental approach allowed me to focus on each stage without overwhelming complexity. By continuously testing and refining, I could catch issues early and make improvements, leading to a polished final scene.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The tactics of modular design and iterative refinement are applicable to many future projects, especially those that involve complex visuals or interactions. By breaking down tasks and focusing on incremental improvements, I can create well-organized, adaptable code that is easier to debug and extend. This approach will be valuable in future computational graphics projects or even broader software development.

How do I approach developing programs?
When developing programs, I focus on creating functional, maintainable code that meets project requirements. For this 3D scene, I incorporated both keyboard and mouse controls to allow interactive navigation, adding camera and lighting adjustments to enhance the user experience. Each component was developed individually, then integrated into the final project to ensure smooth functionality and minimal bugs.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I adopted a modular development strategy, writing custom functions to handle different aspects of the scene, like object rendering, camera controls, and lighting effects. This helped me maintain clear and organized code while reducing duplication. I also leveraged iterative testing, allowing me to identify and address issues with each component as it was added to the scene.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was central to my development process, allowing me to improve each component incrementally. For example, I iterated on the lighting setup multiple times to achieve a balanced look that would highlight the details of each object. Similarly, I refined the camera controls to provide a smooth and intuitive navigation experience. This iterative approach helped ensure that each feature was fully functional before moving on to the next.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Throughout the milestones, my approach to development became more structured and methodical. I learned the value of testing small changes regularly and building on a solid foundation of code. By the final project, I was more comfortable breaking down complex tasks into manageable parts, leading to a more organized and efficient development process.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science offers a range of skills that are essential for both my educational and professional goals. Specifically, working on computational graphics has strengthened my understanding of visual simulations and interactive environments, skills that are valuable in fields like software engineering, game development, and visualization.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of 3D modeling, texture mapping, and lighting—all fundamental skills in computational graphics. These skills will support my future studies in computer science, as they are applicable to both visualization and user interface design. The technical and design experience I gained will help me tackle more advanced graphics courses or projects that involve rendering and interactivity.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The skills I’ve developed in creating a realistic 3D environment, managing lighting, and implementing interactive controls are highly applicable in software development fields that involve visual elements. Whether working on interfaces, simulations, or visual data representations, the ability to create intuitive and visually appealing scenes will be an asset in my career. Computational graphics provides a unique blend of technical and creative skills, which I can leverage in a variety of professional roles.
